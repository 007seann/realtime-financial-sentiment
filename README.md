# README: voice-of-the-market
 
## 1. Why did you start your project?

This project was initiated in response to the increasing importance of real-time sentiment analysis in financial markets. As a retail investor with five years of experience and a 7.5% compound annual growth rate, I encountered firsthand how sensitive assets like Nvidia and Bitcoin are to sentiment shocks. Existing systems failed to capture the breadth and speed of multi-source financial sentiment. This gap motivated the development of an end-to-end, real-time sentiment scoring system capable of integrating multiple perspectives from financial text—such as regulatory filings, earnings call transcripts, and expert analysis reports—for better forecasting of stock returns and volatility.

## 2. What issues did you find technically and in a domain context?

### Domain Challenges:
- Financial sentiment is fragmented across multiple textual sources and stakeholder viewpoints.
- Existing sentiment systems often focus only on one source (e.g., news) and ignore broader market voices.

### Technical Challenges:
- **Scalability**: Handling 300,000+ documents (~1.5 billion tokens) across different formats and APIs.
- **Orchestration**: Building a real-time system that automates data collection, preprocessing, and model inference.
- **Supervision**: Labeling sentiment metrics for both return and volatility without human annotation.
- **Efficiency**: Real-time preprocessing and data transformation under heavy computational constraints.

## 3. What solutions did you consider?

- **Lexicon-Based vs. Machine Learning Approaches**: Lexicon methods offer transparency but lack nuance. ML models, particularly supervised learning with financial labels, provide better predictive power.
- **Sequential vs. Parallel Data Processing**: Given the volume of data, a parallel and distributed system using Apache Spark and Dockerized pipelines was explored.
- **Single-Source vs. Multi-Source Input**: Initial implementations using only 10-K filings (Minf1) were expanded in Minf2 to include earnings calls and expert reports for better performance and robustness.
- **Cloud-Hosted vs. Local Deployment**: Azure Cloud was chosen for scalability, supported by Docker and Apache Airflow for CI/CD and orchestration.

## 4. What is your final decision among solutions?

The final solution is a real-time, fully automated, and multi-source sentiment scoring system deployed on Microsoft Azure. It comprises:

- **FTRM (Financial Text Retrieval Model)**: Fetches data from EDGAR, Seeking Alpha, and APIs.
- **PDCM (Parallel Data Construction Model)**: Uses Apache Spark to transform and structure data efficiently.
- **SSPM (Sentiment Score Prediction Model)**: Produces return- and volatility-predictive sentiment scores using a supervised model adapted from Zheng et al.’s lexicon learning method.

This system not only supports real-time decision-making for traders and analysts but also provides a transparent, extensible, and scalable framework for future research and deployment.


## How to Run the System

### 1. Activate the Environment
```bash
conda activate seanchoi
```

### 2. Set Up Dependencies  
If the system hasn't been set up yet, choose one of the following methods to install dependencies.  
> **Recommended**: Option 2 (Docker image)

**Option 1: Install Locally**
```bash
pip download --dest /data/seanchoi/airflow/airflow_docker/deps -r /data/seanchoi/airflow/airflow_docker/requirements.txt --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver
```

**Option 2: Load Prebuilt Docker Image**
```bash
docker load -i /data/seanchoi/airflow/airflow_docker/seanchoi_image.tar
```

> _Note for Hao_: You can skip this step if you're testing the system on the server — the setup and image are already in place.

### 3. Launch the System
Navigate to the project directory and start the services:
```bash
cd /data/seanchoi/airflow
docker compose up
```
(Optional) If an image is not built, build an image first:
```bash
docker compose build
```

(Optional) If the system is already running, stop it first:
```bash
docker compose down
```

### 4. Access the Airflow UI
